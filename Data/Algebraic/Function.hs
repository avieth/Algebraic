-- The presence of (...) means we need an open type family; we must be able to
-- add new entries to the lattice. But we must also avoid any type family
-- overlap. This can be done by giving only the lower-left half of the table
-- (it's commutative) and giving a type family which indicates which section
-- of the table we're in:
--    1. Leftmost column
--    2. Bottom row
--    3. Diagonal
--    4. Lower-left half (excluding diagonal)
--    5. Upper-right half (excluding diagonal)
-- One way to do this is to have each type determine a unique natural number,
-- or a symbol meaning infinity (for the EmptyArrow). This determines the
-- order of the rows (or columns, but we choose rows). Then we're in the
-- lower-left whenever the first index is greater than the second index, and
-- similar index-based rules for the other cases.
-- We demand particular instances for the lower-left half excluding the
-- diagonal and the leftmost and bottom rows. That's to say: the n'th
-- arrow must give its GLB with all of the earlier arrows (n-1)'th, (n-2)'th
-- excluding the 0'th (Kleisli Identity).
--
-- Injective type family use case? I think so! But do we *need* injective
-- type families? Data families are injective, but we can't use those, because
-- we need to go to some existing type Nat+Infinity.
-- Functional dependencies are tempting. Can they help us? Yes, but it's a hack.

-- Until we can assert that ArrowGLBOrderT is injective, we use a hack:
-- demand that every member of the order is an instance of this class, and

--
-- With injective type families, we can delete the ArrowGLBOrder class and
-- its instances.
